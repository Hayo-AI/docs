Our goal is to support most mainstream models globally, allowing users to continuously track the latest developments in language models through the use of Hayo AI. In the future, we plan to roll out a variety of new features, including document reading and analysis features for PDF/TXT files, voice scenario applications for AI digital life, and a more convenient AI document generation editor. We are committed to providing you with better service through continuous innovation and improvement.

## Quick Start

We recommend having a private chat with the AI robot for a better chatting experience.

On our homepage, click "AI Chatbot" to start a conversation with the AI. At the top of the chat window, you can freely switch between different AI models according to your dialogue needs.

Some AI models provide intelligent conversation suggestions. During the chat, the system will generate 3 possible conversation prompts based on the latest dialogue message, which you can click on to continue the conversation quickly, making the dialogue more intelligent and efficient.

## Prompt Library

Our prompt library has accumulated a wealth of fantastic prompts for you to explore. Here, you can discover many creative, fun, and practical prompts. Regardless of which prompt you choose, with just one click, you can quickly embark on your chatting or drawing journey. These prompts are carefully selected and organized to inspire you and enhance your creative enjoyment.

## Prompt Chatbot

The Hayo AI Tab on the homepage or in the prompt library provides a multitude of chat prompts. You can click on any prompt to start an exclusive AI chatbot based on that prompt. The settings for these bots can be adjusted at any time to meet your specific needs.

All previously used chat prompts can be quickly found in the conversation list on the homepage, eliminating the need for repeated searches. At the same time, the quick message feature can help you communicate efficiently with the AI chatbot.

## Create a Prompt Chatbot

By clicking on the "+" button in the upper right corner of the homepage, you can quickly create a custom prompt. Specify the prompt name, content, and category, and then you can choose to make the prompt public, sharing it with other users. After successful creation, click "Chat" to generate an exclusive chatbot.

## AI Conversation Best Practices

When chatting with AI, please refer to the following guidelines for a better conversation experience:

1. **Clarify your question or need**: Before communicating with the AI, make sure you clearly know what your question or need is. This can help you express your intentions better and get more accurate answers or assistance.
2. **Use clear and concise language**: Try to use simple and clear language to express your question. Avoid using vague or ambiguous terms as they may lead to inaccurate or undesirable responses from the AI.
3. **Avoid overly subjective or personalized questions**: AI generally handles fact-based and general knowledge questions better. Therefore, try to avoid overly subjective or personalized questions, like your favorite movie or emotional experiences. AI is better suited to answer questions that are more objective.
4. **Provide sufficient context**: To help the AI understand your question better, you can provide some related context. This helps the AI to accurately understand your intentions and provide more relevant answers.
5. **Try specific prompts or rephrasing your question**: If you feel the AI does not understand your question, try rephrasing it or specifying a prompt. Sometimes, using different wording or providing more details can help the AI answer your question better.
6. **Verify the results**: While AI is powerful, it can still provide incorrect or inaccurate answers. Therefore, after receiving an answer from AI, it's best to verify the result, especially for critical questions or situations that require high accuracy.
7. **Maintain respect and courtesy**: Even though AI is a computer program, maintain respect and courtesy when communicating with it. Avoid using aggressive or offensive language to ensure a positive and friendly exchange.
