# AI Drawing
### Quick Start

Please select "AI Drawing" on the Hayo homepage to enter the drawing interface. In the input box, enter the picture you want to draw and submit it. AI will start processing the command. If your command is correct, AI will start drawing, which takes about 20 seconds.

You can also start with a drawing instruction. Go to the homepage-prompt library-AI drawing category, and check the popular drawing prompts. Click "Draw" to use the prompt to draw.

### Common Commands

In your workspace, type "/" or click "/" to activate the command interface. You will see all the commands of the Hayo AI draw:
